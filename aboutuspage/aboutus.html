      <p><font size="6">My name is Tierra Buissereth. I am a rising junior at Scotch Plains Fanwood High School in Scotch Plains, NJ.
       At school, I am a member of the marching band and the Vice President of French Club. In my free time I like to watch TV,
       read the news, listen to music, and educate myself on social justice matters. During this past summer, I was given the
       opportunity to participate in the Girls Who Code Summer Immersion Program. Through the program I learned several coding
       languages and how to use coding for good.</p>

          <p>I am Aurpita Shafi, and I am a rising junior at Mainland Regional High School in Linwood, NJ. I am really interested in politics.
            I also really enjoy volunteering with my friends, so I am in Interact Club and Key Club. I am also in Spanish Club. I am also a member of
            the Society of Young Muslim Women. In my free time, I enjoy watching telenovelas on Netflix, and taking naps. Before this program, I found
            computer science a little boring, and didn't really see any flexibility with it, but after this program, I have seen that it is an
            incredibly diverse field, and I hope to go further with this, and see the difference I can make with it.<font-size="6"</p>
